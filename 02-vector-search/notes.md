- FastEmbed is an optimized embedding solution designed specifically for Qdrant. It delivers low-latency, CPU-friendly embedding generation, eliminating the need for heavy frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. It uses quantized model weights and ONNX Runtime, making it significantly faster than traditional Sentence Transformers on CPU while maintaining competitive accuracy.
